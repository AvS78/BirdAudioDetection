AADHAAR-Adaptive Acoustic DSP Help for Avian Audio Recognition

# Context. 
Various interest groups including ecologists require a robust, mass deploy-able, low cost solution to identify bir presence in space-time dimensions. Signal processing and advances in Machine learning have the potential to address above need.
# Aims. 
Explore and mature an accurate, automated, and generalized Avian presence classifier based on avian audio signal detection. Classifier aim is binary: Presence or Absence of avian presence, with no species specificity or avian density estimation
# Methods. 
3 iterative step exploration: Signal Validation Transformation, Feature Extraction, Machine learning Model Architecture. Performance evaluation using a mixture of confusion matrix and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC)- Area Under Curve(AUC).
# Results. 
Achieved an Accuracy of 84% and AUC of 74% on unseen data. Industry best AUC 89%. Thoughtful model design to audio signal and problem definition found beneficial vs a complex neural network model (# of params)
